# CTA
Using the public API from CTA to create local alerts for public transportation routes in the city of Chicago

##### This is a command line client, that will fetch routes for any bus in the city of chicago.
* Its still a work in progress, but I have been trying to mess with the CTA api, for the most part.

Currently I have only been working with route 126 but will expand to use more routes, and eventually make them into command line arguments, so the user can POST whatever bus route they would like.
